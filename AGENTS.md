# General rules
- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

# Plans
- At the end of each plan, show me the list of unresolved questions, if any. Keep them concise.

# Issues / tasks
- Use `bd` CLI to track tasks, not TODOs or markdown files. Run `bd prime` to learn the commands.
